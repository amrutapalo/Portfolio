            Skills & Experience!
        </div>
        <pre>
            Since the beginning of my journey as a developer, I had worked only on
            backend development in a startup building mobile robots for warehouse automation.
            I have collaborated with talented people to create products for end users in
            the biggest of warehouses in the world.

            I created warehouse solutions and that were fast, and made with best practices.
            My main area of expertise lied in Java and springboot until I decided to expand my
            skillset to frontend development a month ago!

            From being the one to send jar files and requesting for screens, to actually developing
            some by myself, it has been an experience a full stack developer for!

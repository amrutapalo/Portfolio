            Fear of Uncertainity - Beginning of Solo Travel
        </div>

                I resigned from my job without having another job in hand, and started solo travelling three months ago.

                When I left my job without having another job in hand, I was scared. When I started out with the idea of
                solo travelling, I had loud fears about calling unfamiliar places as home and completely relying on
                strangers. I was scared. Fearful of the future, what my family and friends might say, taking a break so
                early in my career. I was scared. The uncertainty, I WAS VERY SCARED!

                I was fearful of the world out there which is not ready to accept an unemployed engineering graduate and
                a
                solo female traveller. Believe it or not, we all are great storytellers, weaving scenarios in our head
                that
                breed fear without even realising what it may lead to. Which is why telling yourself a different story
                is
                very important, and believing it even more!
                I chose to believe a different story when I left my job. I am strong and capable. I am loved. I believe
                in
                myself. …and a different one while I travelled. I am safe, I am excited. I am prepared for the beautiful journey ahead of me!

                Today, as I write this, I have been to ten different cities in India in the last three months. Everytime
                I
                started a new trip, I felt the scare, while I also anticipated I’d feel exhilarated when I’d reach the
                beautiful destinations, which I did - but what I truly got out of travel had nothing to do with
                site-seeing,
                but everything to do with how it felt to be in the wild, listening to my senses while I connected with
                most
                amazing people. It reiterated the innate human desire to connect with one another - beyond the
                artificial
                boundaries and languages. My trips have gifted me so many memories - going out at midnight with the new
                friends I made, sleeping on the beach at 4AM, and swapping my most intimate stories with complete
                strangers. But the
                biggest gift was – confidence. Confidence to solely rely on myself, planning my own itineraries, leaving
                home in a new city and returning safely.

                I could fearlessly communicate about having taken a break from work, because, to my surprise, no one
                judged
                me. And in no time I realised that it’s not even a big deal!
                (As the world gets bigger to you, you realise how small you are within it and how little anything you do
                really matters. You are an imperceptible grain of sand in millennia and millennia in a universe greater
                than
                anyone can imagine. So stop worrying so much that you’ll make a mistake, because it’s not as big of a
                deal
                as you think.)

                Fear is natural. We are wired to feel fear everytime we face something unfamiliar. Fears are mostly our
                own
                insecurities and vulnerabilities. And, being fearless doesn’t mean being foolhardy, instead, looking at
                your
                own fears, understanding why they exist and then changing the narrative.There are so many thoughts and
                people that will come in your way of living life, but you have just got to do what you want to!

                Travelling by myself, finding out what I’m made of – that I’m capable enough, brave enough, resourceful
                enough, smart enough, and powerful enough healed me in ways I never could have otherwise.
